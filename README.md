I started this exercise by summarising the user requirements:
- users can play 10 frames of 10 pin bowling
- the total score for the frame includes knocked down pins + any bonuses listed below
- a stike occurs when the player knocks down 10 pins in roll 1
  - bonus: pins knocked down in next 2 rolls
- a spare occuers when the player knocks down 10 pins by roll 2
  - bonus: pins knocked down in the next roll 
- in the 10th frame the player can get a bonus for a strike or spare up to a maximum of 3 balls
  - the rolls past the 10th frame are for bonus points only
